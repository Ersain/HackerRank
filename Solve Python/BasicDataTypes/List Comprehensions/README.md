# List Comprehensions



Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers X, Y, Z and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along
with an integer N.
You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the sum of them is not equal to N.

#### Sample Input
```
1
1
1
2
```

#### Sample Output
```
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
```

#### Using with python
```bash
$ python <name>.py
```

#### Using with pyTest
```bash
$ pytest test_<name>.py
or
$ pytest test_<name>.py -v -s
```
