# Symmetric Difference

Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order.
The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.



#### Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer, M. 
The second line contains M space-separated integers. 
The third line contains an integer, N. 
The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.

#### Sample Input
```python
4
2 4 5 9
4
2 4 11 12
```

#### Sample Output
```python
5
9
11
12
```

#### Using with python
```bash
$ python <name>.py
```

#### Using with pyTest
```bash
$ pytest test_<name>.py
or
$ pytest test_<name>.py -v -s
