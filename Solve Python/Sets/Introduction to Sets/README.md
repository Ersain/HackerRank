# Introduction to Sets

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average
of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.
<br>
Formula used:
Average = Sum of Distinct Heights / Total number of Distinct Heights

#### Input format
The first line contains the integer, N, the total number of plants.
The second line contains the N space separated heights of the plants.


#### Sample Input
```python
10
161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174
```

#### Sample Output
```python
169.375
```

#### Using with python
```bash
$ python <name>.py
```

#### Using with pyTest
```bash
$ pytest test_<name>.py
or
$ pytest test_<name>.py -v -s
```
